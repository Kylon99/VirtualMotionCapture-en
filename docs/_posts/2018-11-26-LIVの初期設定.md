LIV Initial Setup

## What is LIV?

LIV is a free application on Steam that lets you record as if from within a game. (Mixed Reality)
[LIV on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/755540/LIV/) You can install it using Steam here.
From the Steam Store Page video you can see it is an application for filming with a video camera and compositing it into VR.
Instead of using a video camera, Virtual Motion Capture can generate video from 3D models and you can then composite as if the 3D model were in the game.

This completes the LIV setup. Next we will create an externalcamera.cfg file with Virtual Motion Capture.
